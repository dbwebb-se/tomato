Calculate interest
=====================================

If we put our money in the bank, we might get interest on the deposited amount. This interest is calculated on year basis and added to your account once a year. To calculate interest we need to know three variables beforehand: start capital, interest rate and the elapsed time.

This is how to calculate interest.

`[result] = ([time] × [capital] × [interest]) / 100`
